# Welcome to my plotting playground
This repository stores fun plots I've made for various presentations and outreach programs that others may find fun or useful!  Each folder represents a different plot -- the information in each folder is outlined as follows:

- A README.md file describing the plotting script
- The output, labeled "figure.pdf" or "figure.gif"
- Any supplementary scripts or information needed
- The `python` plotting script itself

I've also added my personal `matplotlibrc` file so that if you download this repository and run one of the scripts, you should see the exact same figures as found in the folders. If you like the way they look and want your general plots to have those characteristics, follow the guidelines in the `matplotlibrc` file on where to put a copy of the file on your personal computer.
  

## Here's what some of these figures look like:

-------------------------

I try to be thorough in my commenting, but I also try not to overdo it!  If anything doesn't make sense feel free to ask me about it. Also some of these figures I use often for presentations and/or outreach work, so they'll be updated semi-regularly. Additionally, some of these plots I've used in recent work, which I'll cite in the `python` scripts.  For those figures, I'll be creating random data to show in them, but the general structure will be the same as any published or official version.

Hopefully you find these figures fun!  I would love to inspire others to push the limits of their plotting knowledge and strive to make amazing and _understandable and appealing_ figures.  Sadly, so often people don't care about presentation when it comes to sharing their results -- they lose so much of their audience this way. 
### Be the data vis change you want to see in the world!

*Happy plotting!*
