## Big Picture Spectra
This script makes an image very similar to Figure 2 of [Hutchison et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08812.pdf). Undoubtedly, there are likely simpler ways to make this figure -- this is how I chose to code it up.

Because the figure in the paper uses some proprietary data, the code below will generate fake data to be plotted. *Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or suggestions on how to improve this!*
