## Big Picture Spectra
This script makes an image very similar to Figure 9 of [Hutchison et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08812.pdf).  The spectra you see in the actual figure are from some **JWST** Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) runs using some of my Cloudy models as the input spectra.  Instead, for this figure we'll just be using one of the Cloudy models as the plotting spectra (the same model used in other plots in this repository).
