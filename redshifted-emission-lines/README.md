## Redshifted Emission Lines
This code makes a figure showing where redshifted emission lines pop up
in wavelength space. Under-plotted are the wavelength ranges of _Keck_/MOSFIRE and _Spitzer_/IRAC bandpasses.

Of course you can add more lines, especially ones you're more interested in!
Note though that there are some minor adjustments done for certain lines,
so if you do add in or replace particular line, be aware of that.
