## Redshifted Spitzer/IRAC color
This code makes a figure showing where redshifted _Spitzer_/IRAC color as
a function of redshift. For this figure, the Spitzer/IRAC [3.6]-[4.5] colors are shown for
binary stellar population models and single stellar population models for a
large range of ionization parameters, where the stellar populations are BPASS models (Eldridge et al. 2017).

### Future plans:

- animate it? (of course, Taylor wants this)
